 **************************************************************************
  
- What is XPg?  
  
  XPg is a graphical multiplataform tool  (developed with Java Language)   
  that allows to  access multiple  PostgreSQL databases inside a   
  server in a concurrent way.   
  
  Using this application, you will be able to carry out a great quantity of
  operations like querys, insert, elimination, modification of
  registers, etc. on each table of your databases.   
  
  It will be in capacity of creating new tables, to eliminate and to modify
  those tables of the opened databases.
  It will also be able to create and to eliminate databases and to generate
  reports in HTML format starting from querys or tables. 
  
  The JDBC Driver that comes included with XPg is the same what is included
  into the PostgreSQL source distribution and it is compiled to work with 
  versions 7.4.* or higher.
